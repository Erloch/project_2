### About
For project 2 at the Denver University Bootcamp our group created an 8 bit battle game based off stats in our MySQL database. The user has the choice of selecting a character to fight with and opponent to battle. The user is then taken to the battle page where they have the option of choosing a regular attack or a super attack, clicking on either of those until the match is over. 


### Technologies Used:
